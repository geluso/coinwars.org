<h1>Special Abilities</h1>

<p>
  Coin Wars has more to offer than simple 4-vs-4 games. Here are some common
  special abilities you can assign to coins to spice up the game.

  These abilities are identified by the name of the ability instead of by a coin
  type so there is freedom to assign each ability to whatever coin you want. For
  instance, it is nice to use a hefty fifty-cent piece or dollar coin to
  represent a coin with the General ability. But sometimes you won't have a hefty
  coin around. You can downshift all the coins in the game and use pennies,
  nickels, dimes and quarters with a quarter representing the General instead.
  Normally you would play with nickels, dimes, quarters and a hefty coin.
</p>

<h3>The Soldier</h3>

<p>
  A soldier is any coin without any special abilities. A soldier has loyalty to
  one player. A soldier's loyalty is marked either by heads or tails, in
  a two-person game, or by a symbol written on the coin with a marker.
  A soldier's loyalty may be altered by a converter, flipping it over or drawing
  a new symbol on the coin.
</p>

<p>
  Soldiers are often represented using quarters.
</p>

<h3>The Mercenary</h3>

<p>
  A mercenary is a coin with no loyalty to any player. Any player may use the
  coin on their turn. Mercenaries appear most often in multi-person games when
  a coin accidentally flips over in the middle of the game and is no longer
  showing any player's specific symbol.
</p>

<p>
  Since mercenaries often appear from other coins that have flipped over during
  a game with more than two players, mercenaries are really any coin. You may
  also choose to start games with mercenaries already placed on the board using
  whatever coin you wish.
</p>

<h3>The Immobilizer</h3>

<p>
  The immobilizer prevents other coins from moving. Any enemy coin the
  immobilizer touches may not move on the next turn. This only happens when the
  immobilizer is attacking. A coin that runs into an immobilizer is unaffected.
</p>

<p>
  The immobilizer is usually played with a nickel. It is particularly effective
  at disabling a converter, or halting a general. It's very effective at hitting
  and immobilizing the same coin repeatedly, chasing a coin until it's knocked
  totally off the table.
</p>

<p>
  The immobilizer may immobilize multiple coins in one turn. The immobilizer
  immobilizes any enemy coin it touches during its turn.
</p>

<p>
  If a player has just one coin left under their control that coin is impervious
  to being immobilized.
</p>

<p>
  Immobilizers are often represented using nickels.
</p>

<h3>The Converter</h3>

<p>
  The converter converts coins so they're under your control. In a two player
  game the converter flips coins over so they change from heads to tails, and
  vice versa. In a game with more than two players a coin hit by a converter can
  be swapped out for another coin with a new symbol drawn on it to represent
  which player currently controls the coin.
</p>

<p>
  Just like the immobilizer the converter only converts pieces when it is
  attacking. If a coin hits a converter during its own movement it is not
  converted.
</p>

<p>
  Converters don't convert other converters.
</p>

<p>
  The general is imperverious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  If a player has just one coin left under their control that coin is impervious
  to being converted.
</p>

<p>
  The converter is an extremely powerful unit that should be both defended and
  defened against.
</p>

<p>
  Generals are a great tool to use against converters since generals are
  impervious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  The converter is often represented using a dime. It's a lightweight coin that
  doesn't have much pushing power of its own. If you use another coin to
  represent a converter try to respect the nature of the dime and choose
  a similarly lightweight coin.
</p>

<h3>The General</h3>

<p>
  The general is a large heavy coin that is hard to knock around and is
  impervious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  The general's main weakness is being immobilized repeatedly and being slowly
  pushed off the table.
</p>

<p>
  A general is often represented using a dollar coin, a fifty cent piece or some
  other large heavy coin.
</p>

<h3>The Mine</h3>

<p>
  The mine explodes on contact and eliminates any coin it touches. Mines
  are not under any player's control. They don't move. They are not flicked
  around by any player. A mine is removed from play after it explodes.
</p>

<p>
  Mines are usually placed around in the center of the play area. You may also
  choose to give each player some number of mines at the start of the game and
  each player may choose to place them wherever they want, usually on their own
  part of the board. 
</p>

<p>
  Players can launch coins in to mines to make them explode and eliminate coins.
  Players can choose to launch their own coin in to a mine in order to push the
  mine in to other coins too. If a coin hits a mine and the mine hits other coins
  any coin that touches the mine is eliminated, then the mine itself is also
  eliminated.
</p>

<p>
  Mines are often represented using pennies.
</p>

<h3>The Repeater</h3>

<p>
  The repeater grants coins that hit it an extra turn. If a coin hits the
  repeater on its turn it can be flicked again.
</p>

<p>
  The repeat is fun because it can itself be launched around. A player can use
  part of their turn to launch the repeater into enemy territory then take
  another shot and attack an enemy coin. Then, on their next turn they can launch
  a coin deep into enemy territory, tap the repeater and get another ultra
  close-up shot at an enemy coin.
</p>

<p>
  The repeater does not provide its repeating effect to any coin that has been
  immobilized. Any coin that has been immobilized stays immobilized for the
  entirety of a players turn, no matter how many repeat shots they make.
</p>

<p>
  Yes, it is possible for a player to get two of their coins to touch the
  repeater in one of their turns. Both coins would be granted an extra shot.
  For example a player could shoot one of their coins into the repeater and have
  the repeater hit another one of their coins. In this case both their first coin
  and the coin the repeater hit would get another shot.
</p>

<p>
  In one very annoying way to play a coin can hit a repeater and hit the repeater
  again in their extra shot. A player can continue doing this forever as long as
  they keep hitting the repeater during their extra shot.
</p>

<p>
  Basically the repeater is a hot mess and it is rarely used.
</p>

<h3>The Arch of Ugilia</h3>

<p>
  The Arch of Ugilia is not a coin. It's a physical thing that's set up for coins
  to pass under or through. Any coin that passes through the archway gets another
  shot, just like the repeater.
</p>

<p>
  Similar to the repeater the Arch of Ugilia is not commonly played with. It is
  written here mainly to chronicle history of the game.
