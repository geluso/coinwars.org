      Welcome to Coin Wars, a turn-based tacticle strategy game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Listen to the theme song!

    <p>
      Players take turns flicking coins trying to knock all their opponent's
      coins off the table. Some coins have special abilities, like freezing an
      enemy coin for a turn, or flipping a coin over to steal control over it.
      The last player with a coin on a table wins!

    <h2 id="rules">General Rules</h2>
    <p>
    Here's some general rules that apply to all Coin Wars games, whether you're
    playing with two players or any number of players.
    </p>

    <h3>Heads vs. Tails</h3>

    <p>
    This is the simplest form of Coin Wars. Two players each place four coins on
    the table. You should use one type of coin for all the coins. Quarters or
    nickels are a good choice.
    </p>

    <p>
    Players may place their coins however they like. In a 4-on-4 match it is
    common to place coins on each side of the table in a straight line.
    </p>

    <p>
    It it wise to not leave a coin so near the edge of the table that it will be
    easily knocked off with a small tap. It is courteous to place coins in your
    one-quarter portion of the table.
    </p>

    <p>
    Coins may be stacked on top of each other in any combination. This allows you
    to flick them and spread a line of coins across the table on your first turn.
    Stacking coins is not common. It's not illegal. It's just novel.
    </p>

    <h3>Killing a Coin</h3>

    <p>
    Coins are removed from the table and placed aside when they are knocked off.
    It is courteous to catch coins as they fall off. Players call their shot to
    allow another player to help catch any falling coins. No one likes chasing
    coins rolling around on the floor!
    </p>

    <p>
    If a player flicks their own coin off the table without taking out another
    coin it's called a "suicide." If a player's coin falls off the table while
    knocking off another coin it's called "kamikaze."
    </p>

    <h3>Flicking a Coin</h3>

    <p>
    You probably don't want to flick a coin the same way you'd flick someone
    you're mad at.
    </p>

    <p>
    Put your finger on the table so your fingernail is touching the table and the
    coin. Your finger should not be on top of the coin at all, but behind it. Now
    push the coin with a strong quick motion. 
    </p>

    <p>
    It is better to push the coin like this than to flick it. You'll have more
    accuracy and power with your shot. Also, if you're pushing the coins it will
    hurt much less than flicking them.
    </p>

    <p>
    Don't put your finger on top of the coin!
    </p>

    <p>
    You shouldn't ever have full control over the coin. Once you start pushing
    a coin it must maintain one trajectory. If you hmove your finger backwards the
    coin shouldn't following.
    </p>

    <p>
    This adds an element of risk when pieces are close to the edge. It's possible
    to flick a coin too much and send your own coin over the edge while you're
    trying to take someone else out.
    </p>

    <h3>Staying in Your Seat</h3>

    <p>
    Coin Wars is a game of culture. There are no rules against leaving your
    seat when you take a shot. Instead, players are encouraged to stay in their
    seat. It is considered rude and bad form if a player leaves their seat to
    take a shot.  If a player has a coin across the table they may need to
    reach over it and flick it backwards to make an effective shot.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's totally legal to stand up and leave your seat and walk around the
    table to make a shot. Depending on the size of the table, the trickiness of
    the shot, and the weight of the moment players may look down their nose at
    this behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>Obstructions</h3>

    <p>
    There may be things on the table that interfere with the game. Cups, napkin
    holders, pitchers, and all sorts of things get in the way. Clear these away
    or use them as terrain in your game. The game is fun either way. Talk to your
    opponent to figure out what you consider terrain and part of the table before
    you start playing.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're enjoying a game over drinks, for example, you can choose to
    generally leave drinks on the table during a game and ask someone to lift
    a drink when it interferes with a shot. If someone wants something moved
    out of the way of their shot it is their duty to request for it to moved
    before taking their shot. It is lame for someone to take a shot, have it
    hit something and then complain that a coin "would have" fallen over the
    edge if it weren't in the way.
    </p>

    <h3>Play Area</h3>

    <p>
    Usually the entire area of a table is a good size for the game. Sometimes
    you'll be at a table that's extra wide or has some area you don't want to
    go having to chase enemy coins down in. Players may choose to establish
    boundaries so that if a coin goes past a certain point it is considered off
    the table and out of play.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another common table scenario is playing on a table that has a wall on one
    edge. Players can choose to either allow coins to bounce off the wall and stay
    in play, or decide to immediately eliminate any coin that touches the wall.
    </p>


    <h2 id="abilities">Special Coin Abilities</h2>
<p>
  Coin Wars has more to offer than simple 4-vs-4 games. Here are some common
  special abilities you can assign to coins to spice up the game.

  These abilities are identified by the name of the ability instead of by a coin
  type so there is freedom to assign each ability to whatever coin you want. For
  instance, it is nice to use a hefty fifty-cent piece or dollar coin to
  represent a coin with the General ability. But sometimes you won't have a hefty
  coin around. You can downshift all the coins in the game and use pennies,
  nickels, dimes and quarters with a quarter representing the General instead.
  Normally you would play with nickels, dimes, quarters and a hefty coin.
</p>

<h3>The Soldier</h3>

<p>
  A soldier is any coin without any special abilities. A soldier has loyalty to
  one player. A soldier's loyalty is marked either by heads or tails, in
  a two-person game, or by a symbol written on the coin with a marker.
  A soldier's loyalty may be altered by a converter, flipping it over or drawing
  a new symbol on the coin.
</p>

<p>
  Soldiers are often represented using quarters.
</p>

<h3>The Mercenary</h3>

<p>
  A mercenary is a coin with no loyalty to any player. Any player may use the
  coin on their turn. Mercenaries appear most often in multi-person games when
  a coin accidentally flips over in the middle of the game and is no longer
  showing any player's specific symbol.
</p>

<p>
  Since mercenaries often appear from other coins that have flipped over during
  a game with more than two players, mercenaries are really any coin. You may
  also choose to start games with mercenaries already placed on the board using
  whatever coin you wish.
</p>

<h3>The Immobilizer</h3>

<p>
  The immobilizer prevents other coins from moving. Any enemy coin the
  immobilizer touches may not move on the next turn. This only happens when the
  immobilizer is attacking. A coin that runs into an immobilizer is unaffected.
</p>

<p>
  The immobilizer is usually played with a nickel. It is particularly effective
  at disabling a converter, or halting a general. It's very effective at hitting
  and immobilizing the same coin repeatedly, chasing a coin until it's knocked
  totally off the table.
</p>

<p>
  The immobilizer may immobilize multiple coins in one turn. The immobilizer
  immobilizes any enemy coin it touches during its turn.
</p>

<p>
  If a player has just one coin left under their control that coin is impervious
  to being immobilized.
</p>

<p>
  Immobilizers are often represented using nickels.
</p>

<h3>The Converter</h3>

<p>
  The converter converts coins so they're under your control. In a two player
  game the converter flips coins over so they change from heads to tails, and
  vice versa. In a game with more than two players a coin hit by a converter can
  be swapped out for another coin with a new symbol drawn on it to represent
  which player currently controls the coin.
</p>

<p>
  Just like the immobilizer the converter only converts pieces when it is
  attacking. If a coin hits a converter during its own movement it is not
  converted.
</p>

<p>
  Converters don't convert other converters.
</p>

<p>
  The general is imperverious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  If a player has just one coin left under their control that coin is impervious
  to being converted.
</p>

<p>
  The converter is an extremely powerful unit that should be both defended and
  defened against.
</p>

<p>
  Generals are a great tool to use against converters since generals are
  impervious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  The converter is often represented using a dime. It's a lightweight coin that
  doesn't have much pushing power of its own. If you use another coin to
  represent a converter try to respect the nature of the dime and choose
  a similarly lightweight coin.
</p>

<h3>The General</h3>

<p>
  The general is a large heavy coin that is hard to knock around and is
  impervious to conversion.
</p>

<p>
  The general's main weakness is being immobilized repeatedly and being slowly
  pushed off the table.
</p>

<p>
  A general is often represented using a dollar coin, a fifty cent piece or some
  other large heavy coin.
</p>

<h3>The Mine</h3>

<p>
  The mine explodes on contact and eliminates any coin it touches. Mines
  are not under any player's control. They don't move. They are not flicked
  around by any player. A mine is removed from play after it explodes.
</p>

<p>
  Mines are usually placed around in the center of the play area. You may also
  choose to give each player some number of mines at the start of the game and
  each player may choose to place them wherever they want, usually on their own
  part of the board. 
</p>

<p>
  Players can launch coins in to mines to make them explode and eliminate coins.
  Players can choose to launch their own coin in to a mine in order to push the
  mine in to other coins too. If a coin hits a mine and the mine hits other coins
  any coin that touches the mine is eliminated, then the mine itself is also
  eliminated.
</p>

<p>
  Mines are often represented using pennies.
</p>

<h3>The Repeater</h3>

<p>
  The repeater grants coins that hit it an extra turn. If a coin hits the
  repeater on its turn it can be flicked again.
</p>

<p>
  The repeat is fun because it can itself be launched around. A player can use
  part of their turn to launch the repeater into enemy territory then take
  another shot and attack an enemy coin. Then, on their next turn they can launch
  a coin deep into enemy territory, tap the repeater and get another ultra
  close-up shot at an enemy coin.
</p>

<p>
  The repeater does not provide its repeating effect to any coin that has been
  immobilized. Any coin that has been immobilized stays immobilized for the
  entirety of a players turn, no matter how many repeat shots they make.
</p>

<p>
  Yes, it is possible for a player to get two of their coins to touch the
  repeater in one of their turns. Both coins would be granted an extra shot.
  For example a player could shoot one of their coins into the repeater and have
  the repeater hit another one of their coins. In this case both their first coin
  and the coin the repeater hit would get another shot.
</p>

<p>
  In one very annoying way to play a coin can hit a repeater and hit the repeater
  again in their extra shot. A player can continue doing this forever as long as
  they keep hitting the repeater during their extra shot.
</p>

<p>
  Basically the repeater is a hot mess and it is rarely used.
</p>

<h3>The Arch of Ugilia</h3>

<p>
  The Arch of Ugilia is not a coin. It's a physical thing that's set up for coins
  to pass under or through. Any coin that passes through the archway gets another
  shot, just like the repeater.
</p>

<p>
  Similar to the repeater the Arch of Ugilia is not commonly played with. It is
  written here mainly to chronicle history of the game.
</p>


    <h2 id="scenarios">Game Scenarios (2 Pplayer, many players)</h2>
<h3>Two Player Classic</h3>

<p>
  Players each start with four coins, usually all nickels or all quarters.
  Line up the coins any way you wish on your end of the table. Take turns until
  only one player has coins on the table.
</p>

<p>
  Rebalance the game after each round by having the winner give on of their
  coins to the loser. This turns a game of four coins against four coins into
  a game of three coins against five coins. The player with fewer coins goes
  first, or the player who most-recently gave a coin to another player.
</p>

<p>
  A wizard and a noob start a friendly game together. They each start with
  four quarters. The wizard beats the noob in the first game so the wizard
  gives one quarter to the noob so the next game is three versus five.
</p>

<p>
  Playing three versus five the wizard goes first because he has less coins.
  This game is more even but the wizard still wins. The wizard concedes another
  coin to the noob so the next game is two coins versus six coins.
</p>

<p>
  The wizard and the noob continue playing two coins versus six coins. The wizard
  goes first because they have less coins. The noob wins with their overwhelming
  amount of coins. They noob gives back a coin to the wizard so the next game is
  again three versus five.
</p>

<p>
  In the three versus five game the wizard starts first because they have less
  coins. The noob has gained more experience and beats the wizard. The noob
  gives up a coin back to the wizard so the next game is four coins versus four
  coins.
</p>

<p>
  In the four versus four game no player has fewer coins. The noob plays first
  this game because they most recently gave a coin to the other player.
</p>

<h3>Two Player Neo-Classic</h3>
<p>
  Play just like the Two Player Classic Scenario except add in coins that have
  special abilities.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 soldiers (quarters)</li>
    <li>1 immobilizer (nickel)</li>
    <li>1 convertor (dime)</li>
    <li>1 soldier (hefty dollar coin)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you don't have something like a heft dollar coin available for the general
  you can downshift all the coins and play with the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 soldiers (nickels)</li>
    <li>1 immobilizer (penny)</li>
    <li>1 convertor (dime)</li>
    <li>1 soldier (quarter)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Many-Player Games</h3>

<p>
  Coin Wars has a play mode accomodating any number of players. Players each
  get four coins. Use a sharpee or some marker to physically draw symbols on
  the coins to show what coins belong to each player. Players place their
  coins together on their on portion of the table.
</p>

<p>
  Players take turns flicking their coins wherever they want. The last player
  with a coin on the table wins. Players do not give up coins to rebalance the
  game as they would in a two player game.
</p>

<p>
  If a marked coin flips upside down in the middle of a game that coin
  becomes a mercenary coin. Any player is allowed to flick a mercenary
  coin on their turn. If the coin flips back over to reveal its symbol
  it returns solely under the control of the indicated player.
</p>

<h3>World War</h3>

<p>
  Players show up with large bags, buckets, and barges of whatever coins they
  have. Players use a marker to mark what coins they control. Players play
  the game just like they would the many-player four-versus-four-versus-four
  game except there's way more coins on the table.
</p>

<p>
  None of the coins have special abilities, unless of course players decide
  they want them to be so.
</p>

<p>
  This game scenario takes forever to play. There's only one game attempted
  in memory, and no game recorded ever completed.
</p>

    <h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
    <p>
      Special thanks to everyone who's helped develop Coin Wars since the
      beginning. To everyone that's played the game and loved it sincerely. And
      especially to everyone that's played the game to indulge me.
