<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>
Here's some general rules that apply to all Coin Wars games, whether you're
playing with two players or any number of players.
</p>

<h3>Heads vs. Tails</h3>

<p>
This is the simplest form of Coin Wars. Two players each place four coins on
the table. You should use one type of coin for all the coins. Quarters or
nickels are a good choice.
</p>

<p>
Players may place their coins however they like. In a 4-on-4 match it is common
to place coins on each side of the table in a straight line.
</p>

<p>
It it wise to not leave a coin so near the edge of the table that it will be
easily knocked off with a small tap. It is courteous to place coins in your
one-quarter portion of the table.
</p>

<p>
Coins may be stacked on top of each other in any combination. This allows you
to flick them and spread a line of coins across the table on your first turn.
Stacking coins is not common. It's not illegal. It's just novel.
</p>

<h3>Killing a Coin</h3>

<p>
Coins are removed from the table and placed aside when they are knocked off.
It is courteous to catch coins as they fall off. Players call their shot to
allow another player to help catch any falling coins. No one likes chasing
coins rolling around on the floor!
</p>

<p>
If a player flicks their own coin off the table without taking out another coin
it's called a "suicide." If a player's coin falls off the table while knocking
off another coin it's called "kamikaze."
</p>

<h3>Flicking a Coin</h3>

<p>
You probably don't want to flick a coin the same way you'd flick someone you're
mad at.
</p>

<p>
Put your finger on the table so your fingernail is touching the table and the
coin. Your finger should not be on top of the coin at all, but behind it. Now
push the coin with a strong quick motion. 
</p>

<p>
It is better to push the coin like this than to flick it. You'll have more
accuracy and power with your shot. Also, if you're pushing the coins it will
hurt much less than flicking them.
</p>

<p>
Don't put your finger on top of the coin!
</p>

<p>
You shouldn't ever have full control over the coin. Once you start pushing
a coin it must maintain one trajectory. If you hmove your finger backwards the
coin shouldn't following.
</p>

<p>
This adds an element of risk when pieces are close to the edge. It's possible
to flick a coin too much and send your own coin over the edge while you're
trying to take someone else out.
</p>

<h3>Staying in Your Seat</h3>

<p>
Coin Wars is a game of culture. There are no rules against leaving your seat
when you take a shot. Instead, players are encouraged to stay in their seat. It
is considered rude and bad form if a player leaves their seat to take a shot.
If a player has a coin across the table they may need to reach over it and
flick it backwards to make an effective shot.
</p>

<p>
It's totally legal to stand up and leave your seat and walk around the table to
make a shot. Depending on the size of the table, the trickiness of the shot,
and the weight of the moment players may look down their nose at this behavior.
</p>

<h3>Obstructions</h3>

<p>
There may be things on the table that interfere with the game. Cups, napkin
holders, pitchers, and all sorts of things get in the way. Clear these away
or use them as terrain in your game. The game is fun either way. Talk to your
opponent to figure out what you consider terrain and part of the table before
you start playing.
</p>

<p>
If you're enjoying a game over drinks, for example, you can choose to generally
leave drinks on the table during a game and ask someone to lift a drink when it
interferes with a shot. If someone wants something moved out of the way of
their shot it is their duty to request for it to moved before taking their
shot. It is lame for someone to take a shot, have it hit something and then
complain that a coin "would have" fallen over the edge if it weren't in the
way.
</p>

<h3>Play Area</h3>

<p>
Usually the entire area of a table is a good size for the game. Sometimes
you'll be at a table that's extra wide or has some area you don't want to go
having to chase enemy coins down in. Players may choose to establish boundaries
so that if a coin goes past a certain point it is considered off the table and
out of play.
</p>

<p>
Another common table scenario is playing on a table that has a wall on one
edge. Players can choose to either allow coins to bounce off the wall and stay
in play, or decide to immediately eliminate any coin that touches the wall.
