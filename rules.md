# Coin Wars

Welcome to Coin Wars, a turn-based tacticle strategy game.

Players take turns flicking coins trying to knock all their opponent's coins
off the table. Some coins have special abilities, like freezing an enemy coin
for a turn, or flipping a coin over to steal control over it. The last player
with a coin on a table wins.
