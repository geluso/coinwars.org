<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<h3>Two Player Classic</h3>

<p>
  Players each start with four coins, usually all nickels or all quarters.
  Line up the coins any way you wish on your end of the table. Take turns until
  only one player has coins on the table.
</p>

<p>
  Rebalance the game after each round by having the winner give on of their
  coins to the loser. This turns a game of four coins against four coins into
  a game of three coins against five coins. The player with fewer coins goes
  first, or the player who most-recently gave a coin to another player.
</p>

<p>
  A wizard and a noob start a friendly game together. They each start with
  four quarters. The wizard beats the noob in the first game so the wizard
  gives one quarter to the noob so the next game is three versus five.
</p>

<p>
  Playing three versus five the wizard goes first because he has less coins.
  This game is more even but the wizard still wins. The wizard concedes another
  coin to the noob so the next game is two coins versus six coins.
</p>

<p>
  The wizard and the noob continue playing two coins versus six coins. The wizard
  goes first because they have less coins. The noob wins with their overwhelming
  amount of coins. They noob gives back a coin to the wizard so the next game is
  again three versus five.
</p>

<p>
  In the three versus five game the wizard starts first because they have less
  coins. The noob has gained more experience and beats the wizard. The noob
  gives up a coin back to the wizard so the next game is four coins versus four
  coins.
</p>

<p>
  In the four versus four game no player has fewer coins. The noob plays first
  this game because they most recently gave a coin to the other player.
</p>

<h3>Two Player Neo-Classic</h3>
<p>
  Play just like the Two Player Classic Scenario except add in coins that have
  special abilities.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 soldiers (quarters)</li>
    <li>1 immobilizer (nickel)</li>
    <li>1 convertor (dime)</li>
    <li>1 soldier (hefty dollar coin)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you don't have something like a heft dollar coin available for the general
  you can downshift all the coins and play with the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 soldiers (nickels)</li>
    <li>1 immobilizer (penny)</li>
    <li>1 convertor (dime)</li>
    <li>1 soldier (quarter)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Many-Player Games</h3>

<p>
  Coin Wars has a play mode accomodating any number of players. Players each
  get four coins. Use a sharpee or some marker to physically draw symbols on
  the coins to show what coins belong to each player. Players place their
  coins together on their on portion of the table.
</p>

<p>
  Players take turns flicking their coins wherever they want. The last player
  with a coin on the table wins. Players do not give up coins to rebalance the
  game as they would in a two player game.
</p>

<p>
  If a marked coin flips upside down in the middle of a game that coin
  becomes a mercenary coin. Any player is allowed to flick a mercenary
  coin on their turn. If the coin flips back over to reveal its symbol
  it returns solely under the control of the indicated player.
</p>

<h3>World War</h3>

<p>
  Players show up with large bags, buckets, and barges of whatever coins they
  have. Players use a marker to mark what coins they control. Players play
  the game just like they would the many-player four-versus-four-versus-four
  game except there's way more coins on the table.
</p>

<p>
  None of the coins have special abilities, unless of course players decide
  they want them to be so.
</p>

<p>
  This game scenario takes forever to play. There's only one game attempted
  in memory, and no game recorded ever completed.
